			<h1>Name</h1>
			<div>hazycora / Hazel</div>

		<section>
			<h1>Description</h1>
			<div>My pronouns are she/her.</div>
			<div>I am a hobbyist programmer. I have yet to make much, but I'm trying!</div>

			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<div>
				I've made a few projects. I've provided links to some of them below.
				<details open>
					<summary>stinkass</summary>
					<div>Joke imageboard site. I had got the domain for an inside joke with a few friends, and later when I had written some code for an imageboard I chose to use the StinkAss domain to host it.</div>
					<div>You can visit it <a href="https://stinkass.org/">here</a>.</div>
					<div>My imageboard code is not yet available.</div>
				</details>
				<details open>
					<summary>blazebury</summary>
					<div>I've contributed to my friend <a href="https://nrmn.top">Norman</a>'s project blazebury, and I'm hosting a public instance of it at <a href="https://music.hazycora.com">music.hazycora.com</a>.</div>
					<div>It's open source, and you can make a pull request if you have made any improvement to <a href="https://stinkass.org/">the source code</a>.</div>
				</details>
				<details open>
					<summary>whisker [somewhat abandoned]</summary>
					<div>Chat bot for Discord. An assistant made to summarize info about topics, find solutions for simple maths problems, and more.</div>
					<div>Abandoned because it wasn't much fun anymore. I'd consider to add more to it or just improve the code if I get any motivation to though, which is entirely possible.</div>
					<div>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/hazycora/whisker">on GitHub</a>.</div>
				</details>
				<details open>
					<summary>vector-editor</summary>
					<div>Online vector image editor <i>very work in progress</i>. Currently doesn't do much.</div>
					<div>You can view it <a href="https://hazycora.github.io/vector-editor/">here</a>. It's also got a GitHub repo, so if you think you can make an improvement (and if you know anything about JavaScript you probably can make an improvement) you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/hazycora/vector-editor/">here</a> and if you want you can submit a pull request for it.</div>

			<h1>Socials</h1>
			<div>I also am on <a href="https://twitter.com/hazycora">Twitter</a>.</div>
			<div>If you happen to remember walloftext.co, I have <a href="https://walloftext.co/hazycora">a page there</a>. Doubt I will ever use it, but it's fun!</div>

			<h1>Contact</h1>
			<div>Feel free to <a href="mailto:hazycora@gmail.com?body=Hi%20Hazel!">send me an email</a>, but I <i>probably</i> won't ever read it. I'm terrible at managing email.</div>
			<div>If you want me to actually respond, send me a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/hazycora">Twitter</a>. I am always on my phone, so if I don't respond immediately then I'm asleep.</div>
			<div>I also use Discord @hazycora#0001, feel free to add me as a friend if you'd like to chat through that.</div>

			<h1>About this page</h1>
			<div>I was looking for a short domain to get, and checked to see if hazel.dev was taken. It was, and it redirected to <a href="https://hazel.virdo.name">hazel.virdo.name</a>. The site looked cool so I'm using all the same CSS code. Credit for the CSS goes to them, if they were the creator of it!</div>
